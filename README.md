# My Bootstrapped Portfolio

## Description

In this project, I have rebuilt my [portfolio site](https://github.com/bferriman/portfolio.git) using Bootstrap to make it responsive.  I used my own CSS and pseudo-classes to maintain custom color scheme throughout the site and when hovering/focusing elements.

The site was developed to serve as my presence on the web, particularly for prospective employers.  It contains an introductory "About Me" page, a portfolio page containing links to projects I've worked on, and a contact page.

## Opportunities For Further Development

All of the projects/links on the Portfolio page are placeholders for now. As I complete other projects, I can create additional pages for those projects and link them here.

The form on the Contact page does not currently capture and do anything with the input.

The About Me page could use a better headshot.

All images and referenced products on the Portfolio page are intended as placeholders only.  I've chosen them either because I have some work experience related to them (Rock Band Network and Rockstar Rising), or simply because I am a fan of them (Mass Effect, Inside, Magic: The Gathering).
